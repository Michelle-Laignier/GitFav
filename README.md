# GitFav
GitFav is a web application to select your favorite GitHub users and list them in a table. By doing this, you can also see how many public repositories and followers they have. <br>
This project was made for the Rocketseat Explorer course. <br>
To make it, I used: <br>
- ES6 modules <br>
- Oriented object programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism...) <br>
- Promises <br>
- GitHub API with fetch

## Tecs
- HTML <br>
- CSS <br>
- JS
